auto_initialize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``boolean``  **default**: ``false``

An internal option: sets whether the form should be initialized automatically.
For all fields, this option should only be ``true`` for root forms and since
a button can't be an entire form on its own, this is set to ``false``. You
won't need to change this option and probably won't need to worry about it.
